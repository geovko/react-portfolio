## What is it?

I've prepared an online portfolio that utilizes React and is deployed through Netlify. In this portfolio, you can access an about page with a short introduction about me. Questions are welcome. Also included is a portfolio page with various projects I've completed or are working on (links to the repositories and the deployed site are included). I've also included my resume with a link to download the resume as a pdf. Finally, I've included a page with information on how to contact me. In the footer, I've included the links to my LinkedIn and my Github profile.
