            Hello! My name is Philip Kim. I'm currently working part-time at an
            independent pharmacy as a clerk. I'm also doing
            subtitling/translating work (from Korean to English) on the side. I
            have recently completed a Coding Bootcamp provided by UCI and am
            preparing to further develop myself in the software engineering
            field.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            I am very curious about many different subjects, and enjoy learning
            new things. As such, I engage in multiple hobbies, ranging from
            roller skating and Wushu (Chinese martial arts) to music and
            writing. From a young age, I've volunteered extensively at churches,
            singing, playing instruments, translating, preparing powerpoints,
            and managing sound/camera systems.
